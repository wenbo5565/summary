### Project Homepage

by Wenbo Ma

Welcome to my github page. This page works as a "Table of Contents" for my projects' repository. You can find detailed information about each project in their respective repository by clicking the link.

Also I list some of my sample codes here demonstrating my coding style for 2018 job-seeking purpose only.

#### 1. Machine Learning Application Projects

This section includes my projects on machine learning applications in finance, computer vision and etc.

Finance:
  * [Loan Application Prediction with Gradient Boosted Trees Model (GBM)](https://github.com/wenbo5565/AppliedProject_GrantingLoan)

Computer Vision/ Image Analysis: 
  * [Behavioral Cloning (Deep Learning)](https://github.com/wenbo5565/appliedproject_behavioralcloning) - Build a convoluationl neural network (CNN) to imitate a human driver's behavior.
  * [Traffic Lane Detection](https://github.com/wenbo5565/AppliedProject_AdvancedLaneFinding) - Detect driving lanes via a front-facing camera on a vehicle.
  * [Vehicle Tracking](https://github.com/wenbo5565/AppliedProject_CarDetection) - Track surrounding vehicles via a front-facing camera
  
#### 2. Sample Code for Demo Purpose Only
 * Python
   - [Exploratory analysis and xgboost](https://github.com/wenbo5565/AppliedProject_GrantingLoan/blob/master/GrantingLoan%20core.py)
   - [Convolutional neural network using Keras](https://github.com/wenbo5565/appliedproject_behavioralcloning/blob/master/model.py)
 * R (Most of R codes date back to my time at Rutgers University as a graduate student for 2 years) 
 * VBA (not available as it is related to my professional work at Deloitte)
 * MATLAB
   - [Second order cone programming (SOCP) for Sortino ratio without CVX](https://github.com/wenbo5565/misc/blob/master/MATLAB/SOCP_Sortino_noCVX.m)
 * SQL
   - [SQL1 - outer join in MySQL](https://github.com/wenbo5565/misc/blob/master/mysql/code/question2.sql)

#### 3. Optimization and Machine Learning (Theory)

This section includes my projects on statistics, optimization and machine learning. These projects are on theory and method of machine learning, statistics and optimization

  * Distributionally robust optimization and machine learning (working paper)
