### Project Homepage

by Wenbo Ma

Welcome to my github page. This page works as a "Table of Contents" for my projects' repository. You can find detailed information about each project in their respective repository by clicking the link.

Also I list some of my sample codes here demonstrating my coding style.

#### 1. Machine Learning Application Projects

This section includes my projects on machine learning applications in finance, computer vision and etc.

Finance:
  * [Loan Application Prediction with Gradient Boosted Trees Model (GBM)](https://github.com/wenbo5565/AppliedProject_GrantingLoan)

Computer Vision/ Image Analysis: 
  * [Behavioral Cloning (Deep Learning)](https://github.com/wenbo5565/appliedproject_behavioralcloning) - Build a convoluationl neural network (CNN) to imitate a human driver's behavior.
  * [Traffic Lane Detection](https://github.com/wenbo5565/AppliedProject_AdvancedLaneFinding) - Detect driving lanes via a front-facing camera on a vehicle.
  * [Vehicle Tracking](https://github.com/wenbo5565/AppliedProject_CarDetection) - Track surrounding vehicles via a front-facing camera
  
#### 2. Sample Code for Demo Purpose Only

   - [Data mining - linear discriminate analysis (LDA)](https://github.com/wenbo5565/misc/blob/master/R/lda.R)
 * VBA (not available since it is only related to my previous professional work at Deloitte)
 * MATLAB - Optimization
   - [Second order cone programming (SOCP) for Sortino ratio without CVX ](https://github.com/wenbo5565/misc/blob/master/MATLAB/SOCP_Sortino_noCVX.m)
